## Theory {-}

Before you start you should be familiar with:

* Coffee
* Etc
* Etc

## Software {-}

We will primarily be writing R code using the RStudio GUI.

## Setup in RStudio {-}

This is our base setup. Further packages will be loaded in the individual lectures respectively.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, 
                      fig.width = 14, fig.asp = 0.62, out.width = "100%")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse); library(kableExtra); library(cowplot); library(scales); library(janitor);
theme_set(theme_cowplot() +  
              background_grid(major = "xy", 
                              minor = "xy",
                              size.major = 0.25,
                              size.minor = 0.1) +
              theme(legend.position = "top",
                    plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10)))
```
