This is a collection of lecture notes from a course on Survival Analysis at the University of Iceland. Hopefully I can later create a cohesive small book out of it that can be used for teaching.

The notes are based on the book [Modelling Survival Data in Medical Research by David Collett](https://www.crcpress.com/Modelling-Survival-Data-in-Medical-Research/Collett/p/book/9781439856789)
